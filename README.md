- `CatChemi`: A tool to generate compute energies from the Newns-Anderson model along with different orthogonalization schemes. See this [paper](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/156/23/231102/2841333/Limits-to-scaling-relations-between-adsorption) for more details on the implementation and this [paper](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/sc/d2sc05772g) for an application to single-atom alloys.
- `catmap-mirror`: Implementation of the _numbers_-solver for solving a steady-state micro-kinetic model. See this [paper](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/6478e5a9e64f843f412a32a8) for details about the implementation.
- `tpd-analyse: Implementation of a tool to analyse TPD spectra. See this [paper](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/cp/d1cp01992a/unauth) for details about the implementation.
- `aiida-ase`: AiiDA plugin for ASE.
